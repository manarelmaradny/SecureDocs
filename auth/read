what is passport?

a middlware that is used to handle authentication, using strategies.
strategies like (google, facebook, & github) in our case we used google and github.


passport-github2 --> is an example strategy for github authentication, allowing to use OAuth 2.0
to authenticate users via theit github account.
how is this useful? it's a third party that allows app to access user's data without
sharing their password.

- connect to the github application using clientID and Secret.


CallbackURL --> the url the user is redirected to after authentication  (the endpoint that handles the response after authentication).


parameters returned to the endpoint --> access token, refresh token, profile, done.


#######################################
access token : is used to communicate with github on behalf of the user.

refresh token : refreshes the access token when it expires.

profile : data returned (name, id, email, username).

done : auth successful returns done(null, user) if error return done(error, null).
#######################################


summary of the exact flow --> 


1. The user clicks Login with GitHub on app’s login page.

2. They are redirected to GitHub to authenticate.

3. when the user authorizes the app, GitHub redirects back to /auth/github/callback with an access code.

4. The callback function is triggered, where the GitHub profile is fetched and the user’s details are stored or updated in the database.

5. If the authentication is successful, the user is logged in and their details are available in your application.
